# Gen711-Final-Project-
Ethan O'Keefe final project for Gen711-Genomics and Bioinformatics

This project is meant to make students work with fastq sequencing files and use some kind of bioinformatic analysis to create reportable data that can be presented to the class. 

My Project 

Identifying Genetic Variance Linkage to Increased Alcohol Consumption in Wistar rats

I do drug addiction research here at UNH with Dr. Charntikov in the psychology department. In these investigations we often use animal models such as rats to measure behavioral economic demand and quantify addictive propensity. Our current study is attempting to identify individuals susceptable to alcohol abuse. Our study is using Wistar rats as they are bred with a higher propensity to consume alcohol, making it easier to habituate them to the generally unenjoyable taste of ethanol. Our study is focusing on variation amongst certain behaviors and neuronal activation. In an attempt to understand the Wistar's inbred increase in consumption propensity, I have decided to identify variance within it's genes previously linked to alchohol abuse as a means of correlating the phenotypical consumption to genotypic factors that could be analyzed further in future studies.

The first step in this project was to obtain a Wistar rat genome, and a reference brown rat genome. The Brown rat was chosen for its neutral (unselected for) propensity to consume, meaning it should do well as a reference to illuminate any signifigant variation in the Wistar genome. The most up to date widely used ret reference genome, the BN7.2 genome, was assembled from Brown rat sequences, making it an easily accesable and thorough
