# Gen711-Final-Project-
Ethan O'Keefe final project for Gen711-Genomics and Bioinformatics

This project is meant to make students work with fastq sequencing files and use some kind of bioinformatic analysis to create reportable data that can be presented to the class. 

My Project 

I do drug addiction research at UNH. In these investigations we often use animal models such as rats to measure behavioral economic demand and quantify addictive propensity. Our current study is attempting to identify individuals susceptable to alcohol abuse. My project will involve gathering fastq files from rats bred with higher and lower alchohl prefernce. I will examine the interaction of genes previously associated with addiction, alcohol abuse, and reinstatement both within and against preference groups.
