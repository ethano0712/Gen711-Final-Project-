# Gen711-Final-Project-
Ethan O'Keefe final project for Gen711-Genomics and Bioinformatics

This project is meant to make students work with fastq sequencing files and use some kind of bioinformatic analysis to create reportable data that can be presented to the class. 

My Project 

Identifying Genetic Variance Linkage to Increased Alcohol Consumption in Wistar rats

I do drug addiction research here at UNH. In these investigations we often use animal models such as rats to measure behavioral economic demand and quantify addictive propensity. Our current study is attempting to identify individuals susceptable to alcohol abuse. Our study is using Wistar rats as they are bred with a higher propensity to consume alcohol, making it easier to habituate them to the generally unenjoyable taste of alcohol. Our study is focusing on variation amongst certain behaviors and neuronal activation. In an attempt to understand the inbred increase in consumption propensity, I have decided to identify variance in genes previously linked to alchohol abuse as a means of correlating the phenotypical consumption to a genotypic factor that could be analyzed further in future studies.

Our current study is attempting to identify individuals susceptable to alcohol abuse. My project will involve gathering fastq files from rats bred with higher and lower alchohl prefernce. I will examine the interaction of genes previously associated with addiction, alcohol abuse, and reinstatement both within and against preference groups.
